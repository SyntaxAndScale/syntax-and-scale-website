# Gemini Self-Instructions

This document contains instructions and context for developing the Syntax & Scale LLC website.

## User Prompt

> 1. Please use tokens sparingly, efficiently, and concisely. They are an expensive, limited resource.
> 2. My directive for you is to create a single page website for my LLC based in Washington State called "Syntax & Scale". The website will be hosted on "https://syntaxandscale.com". The website should allow people to contact me via email at "iw@syntaxandscale.com". It should inclulde a description of what what Syntax & Scale does: "provide professional consulting services focused on accelerating revenue growth through the enablement of Marketing and Sales teams with automation, analytics, business processes, and technical tools. The LLC may also engage in technical education, software development (specifically in Rust and AI), and digital media production." Feel free to massage that into more marketing-friendly language. The website should be simple html, javascript, and CSS. I wont be using a CMS. I may host the website files on github pages since this will be a low traffic site. The domain is managed on cloudflare.
> 3. Before starting the project, please write the appropriate product requirement documents markdown file (PRD.md), specifications (SPEC.md), and any self-instructions your future self may need to refer to (GEMINI.md), including this prompt and directive.
> 4. Please let me know what clarifying questions you have before you create the website.

## Plan

1.  Ask clarifying questions regarding design, contact method, and branding.
2.  Create `PRD.md`, `SPEC.md`, and `GEMINI.md`. (Completed)
3.  Wait for user feedback on the clarifying questions.
4.  Develop the single-page website (`index.html`, `style.css`, `script.js`).
5.  Refine marketing copy.
6.  Present the final website files to the user.
